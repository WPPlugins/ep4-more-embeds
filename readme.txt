Support for more embedded content on your website. Current supported embeds are Bandcamp, Box.com, VEVO & Twitch.

== Description ==
 
EP4 More Embeds adds support for more embedded content on your website. It makes use of WordPress `wp_oembed_add_provider`
for providers supporting oEmbed, and `wp_embed_register_handler` for the other providers who still allow embedding 
content on other websites even though it's not through the oEmbed feature.

At the moment, the following providers are supported:

*   Bandcamp
*   Box.com
*   Twitch.TV
*   VEVO
